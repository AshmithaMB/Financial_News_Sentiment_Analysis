#### VADER_Sentiment_Analysis
Performing Sentiment Analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) lexicon from the NLTK library

> *Sentiment Analysis of Newspaper Headlines and Descriptions*

* *In this project, I conducted sentiment analysis on three different data frames containing time, headlines, and descriptions from various newspapers (CNBC, the Guardian, and Reuters Headlines) . The project workflow involved loading the data, handling duplicates and missing values, and performing **sentiment analysis using the VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEentiment Reasoner) lexicon from the NLTK library.*

* *I started by merging the description and headline columns into a single text column and predicted the sentiments of the combined dataset. Utilizing algorithms such as **Linear SVC, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes (Multinomial and Bernoulli), and CatBoost**, I aimed to accurately classify the sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. After evaluating the performance of these algorithms, Linear SVC stood out with an impressive accuracy of almost 90%.*

* *Furthermore, I proceeded to analyze the sentiments individually based on the headlines and descriptions separately. This approach allowed me to gain insights into the sentiment composition of each aspect*

* *Overall, The project's findings highlight the significance of considering both the headlines and descriptions when predicting sentiments in financial news. This comprehensive approach using machine learning algorithms can aid in extracting valuable insights from textual data and assist in decision-making processes.*
